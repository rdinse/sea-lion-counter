This is the 37th place solution to the "NOAA Fisheries Steller Sea Lion Population Count" Kaggle Challenge. It is based on an [Inception-v4 network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07261) (pre-trained on ImageNet) and [Count-ception](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08710). Our major change to Count-ception was to reduce the size of the targets to a smaller resolution than the input. Thereby we substantially reduced the time until convergence. Special care was taken to provide additional inputs to the network such that it can perceive of animals beyond the boundaries of the image patches that are fed to the network. The network achieved an RMSE of around 8.4 on a local validation set, but only around 19.45 on the leaderboard. A reason for that is possibly that the test set has a slightly different scaling than the training set and our model is unable to infer the scale from the input (e.g. from sizes of features of the terrain) in order to achieve scale-invariance.
